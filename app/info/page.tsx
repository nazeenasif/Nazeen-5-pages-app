            <p className="text-xl text-yellow-400 font-thin">Plants and animals are essential living organisms with distinct characteristics.
                 Plants, primarily autotrophs, produce their food through photosynthesis using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide,
                 while animals are heterotrophs, relying on consuming plants or other animals for energy. 
                 Structurally, plants have rigid cell walls made of cellulose, and they typically grow continuously through meristems, with reproduction occurring via seeds or spores. 
                 Animals, on the other hand, are mobile, lack cell walls, and have complex organ systems for survival.
                 They reproduce mainly sexually, with diverse life cycles. While plants remain stationary,
                 animals can move freely, showcasing the fundamental differences between these two groups in nature.
                 Both contribute to biodiversity and play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystems.</p>
