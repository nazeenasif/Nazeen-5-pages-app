        <p className="text-xl text-yellow-400 font-thin">Plants and animals can pose dangers to humans in various ways.
             Toxic plants like poison ivy and deadly nightshade can cause harm if touched or ingested, while others trigger allergic reactions, such as pollen from ragweed.
             Some plants have sharp thorns or spines that can cause injury, and invasive species disrupt ecosystems.
             Animals can be dangerous through predation, with species like lions or sharks posing physical threats,
             while venomous creatures like snakes or spiders can deliver harmful bites or stings. 
            Additionally, animals like mosquitoes and ticks act as vectors for diseases, spreading illnesses like malaria and dengue.</p>
